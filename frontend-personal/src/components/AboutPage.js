                I was admitted to Cal Poly SLO in 2019 as a general engineering major, originally wanting to pursue alternative energy engineering.
                After being inspired by science fiction, the daunting chanllenge of coding, and public presentation from brain-computer interfacing 
                &#40;BCI&#41; companies, I switched my major to computer engineering in the Winter of 2020. To approach my interest in brain-computer
                interfacing, I tacked on biomedical engineering as a second major in my undergraduate studies. For the purpose of becoming better at
                developing software I changed my computer engineering studies to computer science. My computer science studies are general in concentration
                but tailored towards a hybrid of artifical intelligence, game design, and graphics. My biomedical engineering studies are concentrated in 
                bioinstrumentation, which involves circuit analysis, signal analysis, and biomedical imaging. Together, these majors have provided me a well-rounded 
                skillset in biomaterials, biomechanics, transport phenomena, signal analysis, artifical intelligence, algorithm design, theory of computation,
                and digital design/computer architecture.

                I have recieved twelve &#40;12&#41; dean's list awards &#8212; achieving a 3.5 GPA or above in a quarter &#8212; and three &#40;3&#41; president's 
                list awards &#8212; achieving three &#40;3&#41; dean's list awards in an academic award. Cumulatively, I have retained a 3.69 GPA. I have an expected 
                undergraduate graduation date of December 2023.

                In Fall 2022, I was accepted in the BS + MS Blended Master's Program at Cal Poly in computer science. This will extend my stay at Cal Poly for a maximum 
                of two years, with an expected graduation date of Spring 2025. My thesis topic is to research and construct a computational model for vision, simulate the 
                processing and perception of light and images, and induce a high&#8211;resolution phosphene image in an organism&#39;s visual field through electrical stimulation.

                Outside of my studies, I train Brazillian jiu jitsu &#40;almost&#41; everyday at Paragon. I started training January 9th, 2021 and am currently a white belt. 
                I have competed at JJWL Fullerton &#40;208lb weight class&#41; placing 2nd in no gi, JJWL San Diego &#40;208lb weight class&#41; placing 1st overall in gi and 
                3rd in no-gi, and JJWL Phoenic &#40;208lb weight class&#41; placing 1st in gi and 1st in no-gi. I also lift weights to supplement my strength for jiu jitsu. Of
                course to supplement all this physical activity, I have been experimenting with nutrition and cooking since I was a freshman in high school. My video game of 
                choice is Valorant by Riot Games, I am ranked Platinum III. I am a big fan of listening to podcasts in the background of lifting, walking from place to place, or 
                doing more passive activities.
